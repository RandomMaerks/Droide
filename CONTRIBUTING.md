# Contributing
This is an instruction on how to report an issue, build, and contribute to this project.

Note that the instruction on building and generating font files are based on the assumption that 
you are using a Windows machine. If you are using other operating systems like Mac or Linux, please 
change the command lines appropriately.

## Report an issue
If you find any issue with the design, features, or the source, please [open an issue](https://github.com/RandomMaerks/Overused-Grotesk/issues/new/choose). But if you're
just here to have a conversation or discuss certain things, you can [create a discussion](https://github.com/RandomMaerks/Overused-Grotesk/discussions/new/choose).

You can follow this template when you're creating an issue:

[TITLE] Name the issue. Make it as short, but as informative as possible.

- Explain the issue in further detail. What is the issue about? What might be causing the issue?
- Include a screenshot or a video if possible.
- How to re-create the issue? Is there a workaround?
- What device/program are you using?
- Which version of the font? Where did you get the font files?
- A "please fix" at the end for a better chance of responding

You also need to make sure that the issue you're reporting has not already been reported before.


## Build

### Requirements
This typeface is designed using [FontForge](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge). FontForge 
allows you to open and edit the .sfd files included in the source folder, export .ttf, .otf, or
.ufo for other uses.

[fontmake](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake) was also used to create variable font and
generate instances.

### Installation & Setup
You can download FontForge from their [repository](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge) or their [official website](https://fontforge.org/en-US/).

Before installing fontmake, you have to make sure that you already installed Python 3.8 or later.
A more detailed instruction can be found in the [fontmake repository](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake).

Open **Run** and type `cmd`. Then type in the following to install `fontmake`:
```
py -m pip install fontmake
```

Once the installation is complete, enter `cd` then drag in the source directory (assuming you've
downloaded the .zip and extracted it). For example:
```
cd "C:\Users\...\Droide-main\source"
```

### Generate
- Variable font (.ttf) using Python/fontmake

If you want to build variable font, use:
```
py -m fontmake -m Droide.designspace -o variable
```

- Static fonts â€” Desktop (.ttf, .otf) using Python/fontmake

You can generate instances by copy-and-pasting all of the commands below: 
```
py -m fontmake -m Droide.designspace -i DroideAnthro-Light
py -m fontmake -m Droide.designspace -i DroideTransit-Light
py -m fontmake -m Droide.designspace -i DroideFutur-Light
```

The output font files will be in either `instance_otf` / `instance_ttf` (instance generation) or 
`variable_ttf` (variable font). When you generate instances, their respective .ufo file will 
also be in `instance`.

### Designspace file
The `make_designspace.py` allows you to build `OverusedGrotesk.designspace` or whatever name is in the
`path = "..."`.

For more information on how to edit designspace files, check out RoboFont's 
[Creating designspace files with designSpaceLib](https://robofont.com/documentation/tutorials/creating-designspace-files/#creating-designspace-files-with-designspacelib)

## Warning

This is an oversimplification of what you can actually do with these tools. I've only included the
necessities required to build and run.

The instruction, which I have to mention again, is heavily dependent on the fact that you are running
a Windows machine, and has not had any required libraries or distributions installed beforehand. I
cannot be liable for any damages caused by improper setup, bugs, incorrect library installation, or
incompatibility.

It is also important that you do extensive research before installing any programs, libraries, or
distributions on your device, and you should at least know what you are doing. If there are 
uncertainties or incomprehension in the process of installing, building, or other, feel free to ask
other people by opening a discussion or an issue.
